# Systems Analysis & Design
Systems Analysis and Design - Portfolio Prep Assignment

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for DriverPass, a company focused on local driving test training. They wanted a web based application that would allow users to create an account, sign up for a package, take practice tests, and schedule on-road trainings with professional trainers. The owner and admins of the system would be able to edit appointments and user accounts, and the trainers would be able to confirm and coordinate appointments with the students.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did particularly well on the diagrams and modeling of the system, which has been a great tool to learn for many other areas in my life. I use different diagrams at work and in my personal projects to help me understand a complex system in a simple, visual way that can be easily communicated to others even if they are not technically proficient.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably revise some of the requirements, as I believe these inherently have the most room for change and improvement. Throughout development of a system, things can change due to newly discovered information, and decisions have to be made accordingly. That is why planning is such a crucial phase, as once you start, it is a bit difficult to reverse things without leaving some time wasted. Going over requirements a few times can help simulate and predict some of these potential alterations before they happen, so it always helps to keep thinking about those as context changes.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The most important thing when interpreting the user's needs is good, open, and frequent communication. The client in any case has an idea of what they want the final product to look and feel like, and they will try their best to explain what that is to you. You on the other hand, start off with no knowledge of what they want, and they have to recreate their vision for you. Using diagrams, sketches, and other kinds of mock-ups, can make this process a lot more efficient, but you need to check in along the way so they can guide you, and you can offer your expert input so they understand any decisions you make as a developer or system designer as well, or else there will be a disconnect and someone will feel unfulfilled.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software at a high level/system level by first thinking about things in a very abstract way, without much fine-grain detail. I tend to use a lot of words like "thing" and "something", because exactly what those things are, probably data, does not matter yet. We must first understand how and where things move, before understanding why they move how they do, which can be discovered by looking at what is the actual input. UML models are an amazing tool, and I love how you can sketch them out on your own and create your own style with them, as long as it fits mostly within the universally accepted guidelines. These tools are amazing not only for understanding a system more yourself, but a lot of people in engineering or business working with engineers are visual learners, so it helps to communicate your ideas about a system to them. This would also pretty much work for anyone who is not super technical.
